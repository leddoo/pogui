- focus:
    - ?

- present:
    - review & plan.
    - element memory management.
        - strong & weak refs.
    - which elements can be hovered/active?
    - tab navigation.

- horizon:
    - more style:
        - classes.
        - rules.
        - structured repr.
    - project structure: library & examples.


- backlog:
    - fix cursor stale state.
    - figure out layout rounding.
    - text layout:
        - trailing whitespace.
        - automatic, lazy layout.
        - `TextFormat::effect`?
            - seems useful to put ligature handling into the text layout.
            - or maybe not? `hit_test_pos` doesn't either.
            - `effect` still seems useful. can be used for user defined, ligature breaking styling.
        - `offset` for all position returning hit tests?
        - reshape word wrapping.
        - character wrapping.
        - text alignment.
        - color font.
        - ligature cursor positions.
        - diacritics fallback.
        - simple text optimiztion (on construction only, shaping during breaking isn't simple).
        - creating derived text layouts for small deltas.
        - min/max width.
        - long line support: split up raw_spans into 16k pieces.
        - solid RTL support.
            - Ali A seems to know arabic.
            - need to render consecutive rtl spans in reverse!
            - parens are probably f'ed up too.
        - color change in ligature: just split it, like for hit testing.
    - layout:
        - layout dependent render children struct?
        - inline divs.
        - padding & margin.
        - min/max/fit_content.
        - box sizing & border, border mode?
    - tree mutation.
    - caching.
    - hit testing.
    - hover & active.
    - cursor.
    - inputs (button, slider, text).
    - overflow & scrolling.
    - selection.
    - animation, programmatic & transitions.
    - vector graphics.
