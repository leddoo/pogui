- focus:
    - focus.

- present:
    - focus.
        - passive focus:
            - click page, tab navigation starts there.
            - maybe used for keyboard scrolling?
            - doesn't set `focus` or `focus-visible`.
        - events.
        - scrollbars -> takes focus.

- horizon:
    - flex layout.
    - event handlers.
        - more events.
        - multiple handlers.
        - add handler: handler -> handler weak ref.
        - remove handler.
    - per-element styling api (set/get).

- cleanup.
    - viewport util.
    - clip_content util.
    - set scroll pos util.
    - set hover, active, focus util.
    - some clear conventions for NodeData state ~ caching.
    - how to release node memory?


- things that need doing:
    - canvas node for custom ui.
    - event propagation.
    - scrollbar "buttons".
        - thinking impl as nodes.
        - they kinda act like non-focusable buttons/sliders.
        - (the entire element takes focus, when tabbed to).
        - maybe a scrollbar NodeKind?
    - style rules?
    - style as *list* of props.
        - computed style as "map".
        - style props are processed sequentially.
        - style props can use compound attributes (eg: `border: 1px black`).
    - more & multiple event handlers.
    - more visual style props.
        - font family/style.
        - corners.
        - borders.
        - shadows.
    - more input elements.
    - structured style prop repr.
    - selection.
    - tab navigation.
    - caching (style, render children, layout).
    - proper set_children.


- backlog:
    - fix cursor stale state.
    - figure out layout rounding.
    - text layout:
        - trailing whitespace.
        - automatic, lazy layout.
        - `TextFormat::effect`?
            - seems useful to put ligature handling into the text layout.
            - or maybe not? `hit_test_pos` doesn't either.
            - `effect` still seems useful. can be used for user defined, ligature breaking styling.
        - `offset` for all position returning hit tests?
        - reshape word wrapping.
        - character wrapping.
        - text alignment.
        - color font.
        - ligature cursor positions.
        - diacritics fallback.
        - simple text optimiztion (on construction only, shaping during breaking isn't simple).
        - creating derived text layouts for small deltas.
        - min/max width.
        - long line support: split up raw_spans into 16k pieces.
        - solid RTL support.
            - Ali A seems to know arabic.
            - need to render consecutive rtl spans in reverse!
            - parens are probably f'ed up too.
        - color change in ligature: just split it, like for hit testing.
    - layout:
        - layout dependent render children struct?
        - inline divs.
        - padding & margin.
        - min/max/fit_content.
        - box sizing & border, border mode?
    - tree mutation.
    - caching.
    - hit testing.
    - hover & active.
    - cursor.
    - inputs (button, slider, text).
    - overflow & scrolling.
    - selection.
    - animation, programmatic & transitions.
    - vector graphics.
