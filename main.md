- focus:
    - ?

- present:
    - plan next steps.
        - `send_message` api?
        - helpers to create elements?

- horizon:
    - scrollbar / layout fix:
        - if need x-scroll, try to grow in y to fit content.
        - and vice versa.
    - focus fixes:
        - stale focus state on element after `swap()`.
        - clear focus on child if remove parent.
            - consider focus_inside.
    - flex layout.
    - event handlers.
        - more events.
            - mouse, keyboard, focus, active, hover, scroll, click.
        - multiple handlers.
        - add handler: handler -> handler weak ref.
        - remove handler.
        - how to prevent default behavior?
            - plain "preventDefault" isn't a good api.
            - want to disable specific behaviors.
            - eg: prevent default on key down will disable scrolling, clicking, and tab navigation. you'd have to check which key is pressed to disable only scrolling. but key mappings may be platform specific.
    - per-element styling api (set/get).

- cleanup.
    - no more `w/2` & create/destroy spam.
    - viewport util.
    - clip_content util.
    - set scroll pos util.
    - set hover, active, focus util.
    - some clear conventions for NodeData state ~ caching.
    - how to release node memory?


- things that need doing:
    - canvas node for custom ui.
    - event propagation.
    - scrollbar "buttons".
        - thinking impl as nodes.
        - they kinda act like non-focusable buttons/sliders.
        - (the entire element takes focus, when tabbed to).
        - maybe a scrollbar NodeKind?
    - style rules?
    - style as *list* of props.
        - computed style as "map".
        - style props are processed sequentially.
        - style props can use compound attributes (eg: `border: 1px black`).
    - more & multiple event handlers.
    - more visual style props.
        - font family/style.
        - corners.
        - borders.
        - shadows.
    - more input elements.
    - structured style prop repr.
    - selection.
    - tab navigation.
    - caching (style, render children, layout).
    - proper set_children.


- backlog:
    - keyboard scrolling.
        - focus, or passive focus, or root node.
    - scrollable elements take focus.
        - tricky because need to lose focus when no longer have scrollbar.
    - scroll parent if child can't scroll anymore, but only after a delay.
    - fix cursor stale state.
    - figure out layout rounding.
    - text layout:
        - trailing whitespace.
        - automatic, lazy layout.
        - `TextFormat::effect`?
            - seems useful to put ligature handling into the text layout.
            - or maybe not? `hit_test_pos` doesn't either.
            - `effect` still seems useful. can be used for user defined, ligature breaking styling.
        - `offset` for all position returning hit tests?
        - reshape word wrapping.
        - character wrapping.
        - text alignment.
        - color font.
        - ligature cursor positions.
        - diacritics fallback.
        - simple text optimiztion (on construction only, shaping during breaking isn't simple).
        - creating derived text layouts for small deltas.
        - min/max width.
        - long line support: split up raw_spans into 16k pieces.
        - solid RTL support.
            - Ali A seems to know arabic.
            - need to render consecutive rtl spans in reverse!
            - parens are probably f'ed up too.
        - color change in ligature: just split it, like for hit testing.
    - layout:
        - layout dependent render children struct?
        - inline divs.
        - padding & margin.
        - min/max/fit_content.
        - box sizing & border, border mode?
    - tree mutation.
    - caching.
    - hit testing.
    - hover & active.
    - cursor.
    - inputs (button, slider, text).
    - overflow & scrolling.
    - selection.
    - animation, programmatic & transitions.
    - vector graphics.
